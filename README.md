## Project 1: Semester Grade Calculator

### Overview
A C++ command-line application that calculates a student's final course grade based on customizable assessment weights and input scores.  
Users can specify the weighting of different components (such as assignments and exams) and provide corresponding scores to compute the final grade.

---

### Features
- User-defined weight distribution for course components  
- Accurate weighted-average grade calculation  
- Console-based input and output  
- Clear and structured computation logic  

---

### How It Works
1. The user inputs the weight of each assessment category  
2. The user enters the corresponding scores  
3. The program computes the weighted sum  
4. The final grade is displayed numerically
